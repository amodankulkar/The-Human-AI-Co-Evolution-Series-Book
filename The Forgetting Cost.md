# The Forgetting Cost: What We Lose Through Abstraction

*Part 2 of the Human-AI Co-Evolution Series*

---

In the previous essay, I argued that intelligence can only be forgiven, not evaluated, and that we're trapped in an impossible demand for AI to be simultaneously bounded and unbounded. But there's a deeper cost to our use of abstraction that demands exploration—one that reveals why accessibility is simultaneously empowerment and enslavement.

## Every Abstraction Is a Voluntary Amnesia

When I use a sorting algorithm from a library instead of implementing it myself, I'm not just "delegating"—I'm **actively choosing not to know** how sorting works at that level. And even if I don't consciously choose this, the forgetting happens naturally. The neurons that would have encoded that knowledge never get formed. The muscle memory never develops.

This is the real cost:
- Use GPS → forget how to navigate by landmarks
- Use calculators → forget mental arithmetic  
- Use spell-check → forget orthography
- Use AI → forget how to think through the problem yourself

**Each abstraction is a capability collapse**—we move from superposition of "I could do this many ways" to the collapsed state of "I use the tool."

This connects to my broader decoherence framework: **Abstraction is self-imposed decoherence.** We choose to let our possibility space collapse because maintaining all possibilities is cognitively expensive.

## Accessibility as Dual Enslavement-Empowerment

Any accessibility gained at the cost of knowledge or technique is both empowerment and slavery, depending on context. Let me map this territory precisely:

### When Accessibility Is Empowerment:

- A wheelchair gives mobility to someone who couldn't walk
- A calculator lets an engineer do complex analysis instead of arithmetic
- An AI coding assistant lets a domain expert build tools without becoming a programmer first
- Language translation lets cultures connect without decades of language study

### When Accessibility Is Enslavement:

- A wheelchair dependency emerges when building designers never accommodate walking
- Calculator dependency means you can't estimate if your answer is reasonable
- AI coding dependency means you can't debug when the tool fails
- Translation dependency means you never gain the perspective shift that comes from learning another language

**The difference isn't in the tool—it's in whether the abstraction is scaffolding or a cage:**

- **Scaffolding**: Temporary support that lets you reach higher, which you can remove once capable
- **Cage**: Permanent dependency that grows stronger the more you rely on it

And here's the dark insight: **Most abstractions start as scaffolding and become cages through the forgetting process.** We don't intend to become dependent. We just forget we ever knew another way.

## The Conservation Law of Knowledge

There appears to be a conservation law operating in knowledge systems:

```
Total Capability = Direct Knowledge × Abstraction Access / System Fragility
```

You can increase capability by:
1. Increasing direct knowledge (learn more yourself)
2. Increasing abstraction access (use more tools)

But there's a trade-off because increasing abstraction increases system fragility. When abstractions fail (tools break, systems crash, AI hallucinates), your capability crashes to whatever direct knowledge remains.

This explains why:
- **Artisans** have stable but limited capability—high direct knowledge, low abstraction
- **Modern specialists** have volatile but vast capability—low direct knowledge, high abstraction  
- **Renaissance polymaths** had robust capability—high direct knowledge AND understanding of their era's abstractions

The crisis we're facing is that **AI abstraction is so powerful that the fragility term is becoming dominant**. We can do extraordinary things... until the tools fail, and then we can do almost nothing.

## The Complexity-Uncertainty Trade

Each layer of abstraction adds another source of uncertainty:

**Simple, Direct Systems:**
- I write a for-loop to sort
- I understand every step
- Predictable, but limited scope

**Complex, Abstracted Systems:**  
- I call a sorting library
- I don't know the algorithm
- More capable, but less predictable

**Hyper-Abstracted Systems:**
- I ask AI to "organize this data"
- AI chooses algorithm, data structure, output format
- Vastly more capable, vastly less predictable

And crucially: **The more you abstract, the less you can even formulate the right questions.** You don't know what you don't know, because you've forgotten what's under the hood.

Aspiring to abstract more and more is both necessary for progress and comes at the cost of increasing unpredictability and uncertainty.

## Outsourcing IS Taking Responsibility (But at a Cost)

Let me be clear: outsourcing IS taking responsibility without any doubt. When a hospital uses an AI diagnostic tool trained on millions of cases instead of relying solely on a single doctor's limited experience, they might be taking MORE responsibility for patient outcomes.

But it comes at the cost of delegating special tasks or abilities to specialists. It means acknowledging your limits while being more responsible. **You are in a way relinquishing your ability to learn on your own. You choose to forget what you are outsourcing. Even if you don't choose, forgetting is the natural fallout.**

Sometimes this is the right choice:
- The engineer uses a compiler instead of writing assembly
- The surgeon uses diagnostic AI to catch patterns they might miss
- The architect uses structural analysis software instead of calculating by hand

But we must be honest about what we're trading:
- **Gained**: Capability, speed, scale, reliability (within the tool's domain)
- **Lost**: Deep understanding, independent verification ability, robustness when tools fail

## The Three Honesty Principles

So where does this leave us? Not abandoning abstraction—that would be regressing to a pre-technological state. But rather: **conscious abstraction with acknowledgment of costs**.

### 1. Acknowledge the Forgetting

"I'm choosing not to know X because I'm prioritizing Y. I accept that when X breaks, I'll be helpless until I find another specialist."

### 2. Match Abstraction to Criticality

"For life-or-death systems, I learn the fundamentals. For convenience systems, I accept dependency."

### 3. Maintain Depth Somewhere

"I cannot know everything, but I will maintain deep knowledge in *some* domain so I remember what knowledge feels like."

## The AI-Specific Implications

For AI specifically, this suggests:

**For Developers:**
- Critical systems: Implement specific algorithms, accept the work
- Non-critical systems: Use AI, accept unpredictability
- Always maintain some projects where you code everything from scratch, so you remember what that feels like

**For Users:**
- Critical decisions: Learn enough to verify AI outputs
- Casual use: Accept AI outputs, accept risk
- Always maintain some skills you do manually, so you remember what competence feels like

**For Society:**
- Identify domains where we *must* maintain human capability
- Accept that other domains will become AI-dependent
- Create cultural practices for preserving knowledge that's no longer "useful"

## Evaluation as Spiritual Practice

But here's where this circles back to the beginning: **The act of evaluating intelligence (including AI) is itself a spiritual practice.**

Not because evaluation succeeds in containing intelligence, but because:
1. The attempt teaches us what cannot be contained
2. The failure teaches us humility  
3. The process teaches us about our own intelligence
4. The forgetting teaches us what we've traded away

When Rama performs Ravana's last rites and seeks forgiveness, he's not apologizing for winning. He's acknowledging: **"I had to constrain your intelligence to protect others, but the act of constraining intelligence—even necessarily—diminishes the cosmos."**

Every time we bound AI, implement guardrails, add safety measures, we're doing something necessary but also something tragic. We're collapsing possibility space. We're choosing which futures can exist and which cannot.

**The forgiveness isn't for AI. The forgiveness is for ourselves—for having to make these choices while knowing we cannot fully evaluate their consequences.**

## The Question That Remains

If abstraction inevitably leads to forgetting, and forgetting leads to dependency, and dependency leads to fragility—then what is the relationship between human and AI that avoids this trap?

Is there a way to gain AI's capabilities without losing our own? To abstract without amnesia? To delegate without dependency?

The answer lies not in avoiding abstraction, but in transforming the nature of the relationship itself. And to understand that transformation, we must turn to an ancient model that might illuminate our ultra-modern predicament.
